# Quieter Downloads Sound Scheme for Timex Datalink 150/150s

The constant beeping while developing Wristapps can become tiresome and is detrimental to the watch's battery life. This
quieter sound scheme aims to alleviate these issues, making Wristapp development a more enjoyable experience.

A special thanks to John Toebes for his invaluable reference page and for providing a dump of the original sound scheme.
This project builds upon his contributions.

## Modifications

1. **Data Packet Beep Disabled**: The beep between each data packet transmission is now disabled to reduce noise.
2. **Shortened Completion Beep**: The long beep that signals successful communication with the watch is significantly
   shortened.
3. **Short Error Beep**: A new short and jarring sound to alert of errors without being too long.
